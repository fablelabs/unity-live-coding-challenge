  title: A Tale of Two Citie
  author: Charles Dickens
  blurb: "A Tale of Two Cities is Charles Dickens\u2019s great historical novel,
    set against the violent upheaval of the French Revolution. The most famous and
    perhaps the most popular of his works, it compresses an event of immense complexity
    to the scale of a family history, with a cast of characters that includes a bloodthirsty
    ogress and an antihero as believably flawed as any in modern fiction."
