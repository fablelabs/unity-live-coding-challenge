  title: Emma
  author: Jane Austin
  blurb: "Beautiful, clever, rich\u2014and single\u2014Emma Woodhouse is perfectly
    content with her life and sees no need for either love or marriage. Nothing,
    however, delights her more than interfering in the romantic lives of others.
    But when she ignores the warnings of her good friend Mr. Knightley and attempts
    to arrange a suitable match for her protegee Harriet Smith, her carefully laid
    plans soon unravel and have consequences that she never expected. With its imperfect
    but charming heroine and its witty and subtle exploration of relationships, Emma
    is often seen as Jane Austen's most flawless work."
