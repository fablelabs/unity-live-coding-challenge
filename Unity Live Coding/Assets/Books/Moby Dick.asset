  title: Mmoby Dick; Or, The Whale
  author: Herman Melville
  blurb: 'Moby Dick is the story of Captain Ahab''s quest to avenge the whale that
    ''reaped'' his leg. The quest is an obsession and the novel is a diabolical study
    of how a man becomes a fanatic. But it is also a hymn to democracy. Bent as the
    crew is on Ahab s appalling crusade, it is equally the image of a co-operative
    community at work:'
